<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RTD Resistance Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two-wire RTD</li><li>Three-wire RTD</li><li>Four-wire RTD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The RTD resistance market encompasses three main types: two-wire, three-wire, and four-wire RTDs. Two-wire RTDs are cost-effective and simple but can suffer from measurement errors due to lead resistance. Three-wire RTDs improve accuracy by compensating for one lead’s resistance, making them suitable for most applications. Four-wire RTDs offer the highest precision by eliminating lead resistance entirely, ideal for critical measurements. Each type caters to varying needs in industrial, automotive, and laboratory settings, balancing cost and accuracy requirements.</p></p>
