<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The UV-Visible Spectrometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Beam UV-Vis Spectrophotometers</li><li>Double-Beam UV-Vis Spectrophotometers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The UV-Visible spectrometer market is primarily segmented into two types: single-beam and double-beam UV-Vis spectrophotometers. Single-beam spectrophotometers measure the intensity of light passing through a sample and are generally simpler and more affordable. In contrast, double-beam spectrophotometers use two light paths—one through the sample and one through a reference—providing higher accuracy and stability by compensating for fluctuations in light intensity. Both types are widely used in laboratories for quantitative analysis in various fields such as chemistry and biology.</p></p>
