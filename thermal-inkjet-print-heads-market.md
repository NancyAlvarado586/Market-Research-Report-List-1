<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Inkjet Print-heads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Inkjet</li><li>Random Inkjet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal inkjet print-heads are categorized into two main types: continuous inkjet and random inkjet. Continuous inkjet (CIJ) systems operate by maintaining a constant flow of ink, using electrical charges to direct droplets, making them suitable for high-speed industrial applications. In contrast, random inkjet systems, like thermal inkjet, eject ink droplets on demand, providing precise control over the printing process. This makes them ideal for applications requiring high resolution and accuracy, such as photo printing and document preparation.</p></p>
