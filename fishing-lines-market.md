<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fishing Lines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Braided</li><li>Monofilament</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fishing lines market is primarily categorized into two types: braided and monofilament lines. Braided lines consist of multiple strands woven together, offering superior strength, sensitivity, and reduced visibility in water. They resist abrasion and have minimal stretch, making them ideal for heavy-duty fishing.
